# Wordle  

This project is a clone of the popular word-guessing game, _Wordle_. The game was created only using Python and Pygame, which means all logic, design, and animations were created from scratch to the best of my ability. Try the game out for yourself! The instructions to download are below.

## How To Play
A random 5-letter word is selected. Your job is to guess the word in 6 guesses or less.
  
Each letter will be assigned a color value: Gray, Yellow, or Green.
  Gray means the letter is not in that word.

  Yellow means the letter is in that word, but not in that spot.

  Green means the letter is in the right spot!
