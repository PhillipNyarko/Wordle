# Wordle 

This project is a clone of the popular word-guessing game, _Wordle_. The game was created only using Python and Pygame, which means all logic, design, and animations were created from scratch to the best of my ability. Try the game out for yourself! The instructions to download are below.

Each letter will be assigned a color value: Gray, Yellow, or Green.
  Gray means the letter is not in that word.
